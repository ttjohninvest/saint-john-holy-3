            in Our Lady of Peace Catholic Church in Honolulu command: pray all
            night from a lady in church I prayed all night except for a few
            moments when I almost fell asleep near the morning I said "I love
            the Lord thy God with all of my heart, mind, soul and strength" over
            and over again I was sitting on the edge of the bed with my head
            down, when the morning light appeared, I began to lift my head and I
            heard a voice say "keep your head down" I kept my head down and I
            heard a voice say "graduation" and "diploma." During this time I had
            a vision of a man dressed in white and sitting with others in an
            oval room. My focus was on the man dressed in white He had short
            hair. I also saw a green circle and I heard buzzing in my ears. When
            I lifted my head, I was healed. I was so happy. When I got to
            Honolulu, I was troubled, I wanted to be right with Jesus Christ,
            Holy Father God and the Holy Spirit, I could not eat much.
            
            {/* I went to
            a non denominational church service and I saw the word "grope" in
            the Holy Bible so I thought that I was suppose to blind myself to
            get right with God so I bought a razor blade. My friend Jacob drove
            my moped with me on the back to a mountainous area but I could not
            cut my eyes up there. Jacob left and I walked back into Honolulu
            about 10 to 15 miles. Jacob drove me to a small island off the coast
            of Honolulu on my moped later and I went through with it, I started
            cutting my eyes up with the razor blade. I sensed a swoosh of air
            which made me stop. I could still see but things were blurry. I went
            to IHS, the honolulu shelter for the night. While I was in line to
            get a mat to sleep on the floor, I heard a voice say it is going to
            cost 15 million dollars to fix my eyes. When I was laying on the mat
            I pressed my eye through my lower eye lid and my eye was still
            there. I was very happy. I was scared to look in a mirror but I
            check my left eye and it was cut through the pupil and iris and
            dialated. In the morning, I was laying down and a man came over to
            me and yelled "get up" so I got up and walked over to Our Lady of
            Peace Catholic Church, went in and sat on a bench across from the
            cross on the wall. I man appeared and urgently said "I just bought
            these carrots and I need to give them to somebody". I said I was ok.
            He and then returned and said "I really need to give these to
            somebody." So I took the carrots and went outside the church and ate
            most of the carrots. I went back into the church and sat on the
            bench across from the cross on the wall, the place I was at before.
            Another man appeared with a work belt on and he was looking away
            from me. He moved his arms downward and when he did this, I felt
            tingling around my hair line on my forehead. I knew something
            wonderful happened. I saw Jacob and he said "the Lord hears us" I
            looked in the mirror and all of the cuts were taken out of my eyes.
            I was so happy. My precious Jesus Christ healed me. I rejoiced. I
            was with another friend named Marshall and I was told through him to
            keep knives out of my eyes. I was so happy to hear this. 
            vitamin E,
            I met a man in his 90s and he said he will never have a heart attack
            because he is taking vitamin E. He did not tell me that if you take
            to much it could damage the heart. I started taking vitamin E but I
            took to much. My precious Jesus Christ healed my heart. I felt a
            warm feeling in my chest. I was so happy. 
            */}
            I was letting a homeless
            man live with me named Mark. I met him at a non denomination church.
            He stayed with me for about 6 to 8 weeks. He left to stay at the
            Salvation Army for about 2 weeks but returned. I was walking to
            Saint Michaels Catholic Church with my KJV Holy Bible. When I was
            walking, I opened the Holy Bible and started to read and as I was
            reading a felt a suffering come over my whole body. When I stopped
            reading, the suffering would stop. When i got to the church, I saw
            Father Melendez and I told Him what I was happening. He sat me down
            and put his hand on my head and prayed for me. I heard him say "Holy
            Spirit" When he was done praying for me I asked him have you ever
            heard of this happening to somebody before? he said "no" After that,
            I went outside the church. I was really concerned so I went back in
            the sancuary of the Church and slowly approached the alter. As I was
            walking slowly, I felt a strong presence around me, I went to my
            knees and started calling on the name of Jesus Christ to save me. I
            was crying and calling. Two people in the church came over to me and
            helped me to a pew. The man to my left and the lady to the right.
            The lady brought me a rosary and I held it in my right hand during
            the service. They both sat with me during the whole service. I went
            home and within there days, it was evening and I was about to go to
            bed. I called on the phone the cross roads prayer service and I
            received a very nice prayer. I went to bed and sometime during the
            night I heard a voice say "Do you want to be a christian?" I said
            "Yes", I turned over and started to pray right away. As I was saying
            "Christ in me" Jesus Christ came into me. I felt him come into me. I
            rose up and I was looking around making sure everything was ok. I
            was experiencing mental peace and calmness,meekness and gentleness.
            I started praying for James, somebody I met when I was working as a
            programmer. He would read the Holy Bible to me at lunches. I have
            been rejoicing ever since. I am so happy to know that the life of
            Christ is inside of me, inside my heart. I am joyfully Eternally
            saved. Jesus Christ, Holy Father God and the Holy Spirit Eternally
            love me. I am so happy. I love Jesus Christ. I love Holy Father God.
            I love the Holy Spirit. I love Blessed Mary, the mother of Jesus
            Christ all through Jesus Christ's name. I love all of the currently
            resurrected saints. I love all the living saints. I love all of the
            sleeping saints. I love all of the Holy Angels. I love the
            righteousness of God. I love the Kingdom of God. I eat the flesh of
            Jesus Christ and I drink the blood of Jesus Christ. I am rejoicing
            and so happy. Thank you my precious Jesus Christ, Holy Father God
            and the Holy Spirit through the name of my precious Lord and Savior
            Jesus Christ. Amen. Yes. Movies I saw recently and I love them both,
            The Gospel of John, English Version The song of Saint Bernadette, movie.
