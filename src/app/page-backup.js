            in Our Lady of Peace Catholic Church in Honolulu command: pray all
            night from a lady in church I prayed all night except for a few
            moments when I almost fell asleep near the morning I said "I love
            the Lord thy God with all of my heart, mind, soul and strength" over
            and over again I was sitting on the edge of the bed with my head
            down, when the morning light appeared, I began to lift my head and I
            heard a voice say "keep your head down" I kept my head down and I
            heard a voice say "graduation" and "diploma." During this time I had
            a vision of a man dressed in white and sitting with others in an
            oval room. My focus was on the man dressed in white He had short
            hair. I also saw a green circle and I heard buzzing in my ears. When
            I lifted my head, I was healed. I was so happy. When I got to
            Honolulu, I was troubled, I wanted to be right with Jesus Christ,
            Holy Father God and the Holy Spirit, I could not eat much.
            {/* I went to
            a non denominational church service and I saw the word "grope" in
            the Holy Bible so I thought that I was suppose to blind myself to
            get right with God so I bought a razor blade. My friend Jacob drove
            my moped with me on the back to a mountainous area but I could not
            cut my eyes up there. Jacob left and I walked back into Honolulu
            about 10 to 15 miles. Jacob drove me to a small island off the coast
            of Honolulu on my moped later and I went through with it, I started
            cutting my eyes up with the razor blade. I sensed a swoosh of air
            which made me stop. I could still see but things were blurry. I went
            to IHS, the honolulu shelter for the night. While I was in line to
            get a mat to sleep on the floor, I heard a voice say it is going to
            cost 15 million dollars to fix my eyes. When I was laying on the mat
            I pressed my eye through my lower eye lid and my eye was still
            there. I was very happy. I was scared to look in a mirror but I
            check my left eye and it was cut through the pupil and iris and
            dialated. In the morning, I was laying down and a man came over to
            me and yelled "get up" so I got up and walked over to Our Lady of
            Peace Catholic Church, went in and sat on a bench across from the
            cross on the wall. I man appeared and urgently said "I just bought
            these carrots and I need to give them to somebody". I said I was ok.
            He and then returned and said "I really need to give these to
            somebody." So I took the carrots and went outside the church and ate
            most of the carrots. I went back into the church and sat on the
            bench across from the cross on the wall, the place I was at before.
            Another man appeared with a work belt on and he was looking away
            from me. He moved his arms downward and when he did this, I felt
            tingling around my hair line on my forehead. I knew something
            wonderful happened. I saw Jacob and he said "the Lord hears us" I
            looked in the mirror and all of the cuts were taken out of my eyes.
            I was so happy. My precious Jesus Christ healed me. I rejoiced. I
            was with another friend named Marshall and I was told through him to
            keep knives out of my eyes. I was so happy to hear this. 
            vitamin E,
            I met a man in his 90s and he said he will never have a heart attack
            because he is taking vitamin E. He did not tell me that if you take
            to much it could damage the heart. I started taking vitamin E but I
            took to much. My precious Jesus Christ healed my heart. I felt a
            warm feeling in my chest. I was so happy. 
            */}
            I was letting a homeless man live with me named Mark. I met him at a
            non denomination church. He stayed with me for about 6 to 8 weeks.
            He left to stay at the Salvation Army for about 2 weeks but
            returned. I was walking to Saint Michaels Catholic Church with my
            KJV Holy Bible. When I was walking, I opened the Holy Bible and
            started to read and as I was reading a felt a suffering come over my
            whole body. When I stopped reading, the suffering would stop. When i
            got to the church, I saw Father Melendez and I told Him what I was
            happening. He sat me down and put his hand on my head and prayed for
            me. I heard him say "Holy Spirit" When he was done praying for me I
            asked him have you ever heard of this happening to somebody before?
            he said "no" After that, I went outside the church. I was really
            concerned so I went back in the sancuary of the Church and slowly
            approached the alter. As I was walking slowly, I felt a strong
            presence around me, I went to my knees and started calling on the
            name of Jesus Christ to save me. I was crying and calling. Two
            people in the church came over to me and helped me to a pew. The man
            to my left and the lady to the right. The lady brought me a rosary
            and I held it in my right hand during the service. They both sat
            with me during the whole service. I went home and within there days,
            it was evening and I was about to go to bed. I called on the phone
            the cross roads prayer service and I received a very nice prayer. I
            went to bed and sometime during the night I heard a voice say "Do
            you want to be a christian?" I said "Yes", I turned over and started
            to pray right away. As I was saying "Christ in me" Jesus Christ came
            into me. I felt him come into me. I rose up and I was looking around
            making sure everything was ok. I was experiencing mental peace and
            calmness,meekness and gentleness. I started praying for James,
            somebody I met when I was working as a programmer. He would read the
            Holy Bible to me at lunches. I have been rejoicing ever since. I am
            so happy to know that the life of Christ is inside of me, inside my
            heart. I am joyfully Eternally saved. Jesus Christ, Holy Father God
            and the Holy Spirit Eternally love me. I am so happy. I love Jesus
            Christ. I love Holy Father God. I love the Holy Spirit. I love
            Blessed Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ all through Jesus Christ's
            name. I love all of the currently resurrected saints. I love all the
            living saints. I love all of the sleeping saints. I love all of the
            Holy Angels. I love the righteousness of God. I love the Kingdom of
            God. I eat the flesh of Jesus Christ and I drink the blood of Jesus
            Christ. I am rejoicing and so happy. Thank you my precious Jesus
            Christ, Holy Father God and the Holy Spirit through the name of my
            precious Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Yes. Movies I saw
            recently and I love them both, The Gospel of John, English Version
            The song of Saint Bernadette, movie.
